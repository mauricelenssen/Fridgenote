Tips and Tricks.

To get the best user experience, disable the Auto-lock feature in iPad Settings. It will make FridgeNote always able to show calendars and a slide show.

When FridgeNote is mounted on the fridge door, enable in settings the feature âSlide Show to stop after movement is detectedâ this way when the fridge door opens you can see your agenda and upcoming events.

The slide show is activated after a set time and is interrupted when movement is detected by the fridge door, or when the screen is touched.

Enjoy!";
