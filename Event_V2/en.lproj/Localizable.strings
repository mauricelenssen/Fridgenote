Tips and Tricks.

To get the best user experience, disable the Auto-lock feature in iPad Settings. It will make FridgeNote always able to show calendars and a slide show.

When FridgeNote is mounted on the fridge door, enable in settings the feature ‘Slide Show to stop after movement is detected’ this way when the fridge door opens you can see your agenda and upcoming events.

The slide show is activated after a set time and is interrupted when movement is detected by the fridge door, or when the screen is touched.

Enjoy!";
